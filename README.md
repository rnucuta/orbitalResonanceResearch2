# orbitalResonanceResearch2

Built off the work we did in our Post-AP Computational Physics class researching the Yarkovsky effect on an asteroid's orbital resonance (https://github.com/rnucuta/orbitalResonanceResearch).

This code repurposes our old code to find how rescaling the asteroids relates to the size dependency of the yarkovsky effect. We found that as we scale the asteroid up, the magnitude of the Yarkovsky vector decreases proportionally to 1/x.
